# Getting Started

### What's this project?
Hi,Every one,This is my personal knowledge base and technical precipitation,When you have worked in the technical field for a certain number of years, you must also have your own technical accumulation, or document notes, or code accumulation. In 2022, I am ready to migrate the documents and some technical codes I have accumulated over the years to github. After all, a good memory is not as good as a bad writing


### Where is my blog?
Sorry, I once built my own blog website, but due to server costs and other reasons, I finally chose to use note-taking software to complete my technical precipitation. In 2022, I decided to transfer my notes to Feishu cloud documents,Here is the link, if you are interested, welcome to read .
